# Twitter Clone

This is a twitter clone I built using the MERN stack. This is my first ever fullstack project after practicing frontend development for quite some time – see my [Frontend Mentor challenges](https://github.com/nkhatri7/Frontend-Mentor-Challenges), and after learning backend web development I decided to build a fullstack app. I love twitter so I thought this would be a really motivating first project to try and clone my favourite social media site.

This is a pretty basic version of twitter, since it's my first fullstack project, it isn't the best but I'm looking to further work on this and improve it when I learn more in the future (e.g. I could've used redux or React context but I'm not too comfortable with those just yet).
